### <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="30px"> Hello, I'm [Abed Junior Data Scientist](https://www.diogorodrigues.dev/about)!

I am an open-minded individual, who is continually looking to improve and eager to support others as I build a career that combines my quantitative and qualitative skills. I have decided to convert the pandemic into an opportunity to study and enhance my career to become a Data Scientist.
With a commercial background and spending 15 years in the market observing different kinds of problems and how they are solved, I developed an interest in Data Science. This led me to choose the most expert bootcamp in this field, to allow me to combine my previous experience in business with data science.
I want to start my career as a Junior Data Scientist and continually improve my skills by finding a company to collaborate and work with.‚ú®üòç
